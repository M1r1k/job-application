# Reload Job Application

## I am applying for a job at Reload because...

* I would like to relocate to Denmark (that's actually the main reason). New language, new environment, new conditions,
  new people, new challenges. Brains require new impressions and stimulation to grow ;)

* I love Drupal, Open Source and it's **AWESOME** community, that's why I'm trying my best to participate through contributing,
  helping people in IRC and local community, presenting at technical sessions and of course attending as many drupal events as I can.
  Reload seems to be close to me in spirit here :)

* Reload looks like an agency with more coding than management, and I respect and prefer that.

* Also i’ve heard great stuff about you guys from the community :)

## Previous work

I am particularly proud of having been part of developing the following websites/projects:

- [Danmarks Medie- og Journalisthøjskole](http://www.dmjx.dk/) Favourite old site with best client :)
- [Svensk Bokhandel](http://svb.se/) - Cute swedish magazine with interesting editorial UX implementation.
- [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) - Spying on users \*.acquia.com sites bidirectional syncing.
- [CIBox](https://github.com/propeoplemd/cibox/) - Continuous Integration toolbox. Because an action repeated twice already, has to be automated before repeated a third time ;)
- [Smartling Connector](https://github.com/Smartling/drupal-localization-module) - Drupal 8 is close enough to start playing not only with core but with complex modules as well.

However, there are lots of other active projects that I am not able to show at the moment :)
